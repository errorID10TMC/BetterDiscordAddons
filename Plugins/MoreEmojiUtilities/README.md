# More Emoji Utilities

This plugin is manly a combination of these two plugins:  
Use Custom Emoji by idontknow https://github.com/ochen1/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/UseCustomEmoji  
EmojiUtilities by rauenzi https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/EmojiUtilities  

This plugin adds an option to send an emoji in the emoji selector as an image when you right click.
This can be used to send custom emojis that you donâ€™t have access to as a link.The image preview is resized so it is the same size as the emoji. 
There is also the option to blacklist and favorite emojis through the context menu. Favorites show up at the top of the emoji picker and blacklisted
emojis will only show their name when sent.

Use Custom Emoji by idontknow can be used with this to make all of the emojis in the emoji selector so that they are not greyed out if you do not have access to them.
